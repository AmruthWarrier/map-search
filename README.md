This is a solution for the transitive campus problem Statement.
The main idea is to provide students with an easier navigation so that they can reach the venues of events conducted by various clubs faster.
Since there are several clubs in the campus students might find it difficult to keep track of the venue of every event;  our idea provides a robust solution to this problem
The project is still under development and just a prototype as been developed as of now.
